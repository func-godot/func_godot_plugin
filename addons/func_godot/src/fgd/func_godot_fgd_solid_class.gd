## FGD SolidClass entity definition, used to define brush entities.
## A [MeshInstance3D] will be generated by FuncGodotMap according to this definition's Visual Build settings. If FuncGodotFGDSolidClass [member node_class] inherits [CollisionObject3D] then one or more [CollisionShape3D] nodes will be generated according to Collision Build settings.

	IGNORE = 0, ## Ignore origin property and only use averaged brush vertices for positioning. Standard Quake 1 / Half-Life behavior.
